# MegaV
The goal of MegaV is to build a physical implementation of the RISC-V architecture. Specifically, MegaV will fully
implement the RV32E instruction set, and it will do so using only discrete logic.

## Current State
As of September 7th, 2025, the initial implementation is complete and validated and the 32-bit adder component of the
ALU has been designed and sent for manufacturing as an initial test board.
