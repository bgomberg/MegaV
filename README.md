# Mega RV
The goal of Mega RV is to build a physical implementation of the RISC-V architecture. Specifically, Mega RV will fully
implement the RV32E instruction set, and it will do so using only discrete logic.

## Current State
Currently, this project is purely in the concept and exploration phase. This repository is mainly being used as a
dumping ground and scratch space for useful tools I come across and scripts / examples I write to learn more about them.
